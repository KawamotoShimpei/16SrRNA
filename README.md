Construction of age prediction model and cross-nested abundance analysis

A mouse age prediction model using machine-learning analysis (random forest regression) of gut microbiota composition was constructed using a method based on the pipeline in the QIIME2 (version 2020.8) (Bolyen et al., Nat Biotechnol 2019).

R software (v4.1.1) with MaAslin2 package (Mallick et al., PLoS Comput Biol 2021) was used for cross-nested differential abundance analysis.
